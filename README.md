# Hi, I'm Alexandr Gezerdava! 🚀

I'm a Software Engineer from Earth 🌍 (but coding for Mars! 🪐). With a Master's in Software Engineering, I build IoT pipelines and cloud systems, dreaming of powering SpaceX's Martian colonies with my code. Let's make humanity multi-planetary! 🌌

- 🌟 **Currently crafting**: IoT pipelines with Kafka, microservices in Kubernetes, and orbital simulations in C++.
- 💻 **Tech Stack**: Python, C++, Java, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka.
- 🎓 **Education**: Master's in Software Engineering from Taras Shevchenko National University (WES-verified).
- 🛠️ **Mission**: Writing scalable code to support life on Mars and beyond! 🔴
